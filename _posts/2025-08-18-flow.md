## 🎬 Thoughts & Impressions

- What worked: The film brilliantly anthropomorphizes animals while keeping the traits and personality of the original species. It makes the story feel almost real, but just with a touch of magic. 
- What didn’t: 
	- There are some plot holes in the story. The dog first leaves with its pack but suddenly appears in the boat with the cat. Either I missed something or some plot is skipped. 
	- Secondly when the secretary bird ascended to the sky, I interpret this as a metaphor for death, but it's unclear what the real message is. There is no logical build-up to it, and the surrealism feels out of place. 
	- Finally given how realistic the main characters of the film are portrayed, it seems odd to have sea creatures that are not real animals. Perhaps this is the intended effect, to let us know that the flowing water is fantastical and not part of our world. However I personally would have preferred realistic fish and whale. 
- Favorite moments: One of my favourite moments is the ending. The black cat overcomes its timid nature and self-preservation instincts, and bravely saves its friends from the stranded boat on a tree.

## 🗒️ Final Verdict

*For a film without a single spoken word, it's beautifully expressive.*
