## 💭 Thoughts & Impressions

✅ What Worked

- The film brilliantly anthropomorphizes animals while preserving the natural traits and personalities of each species. This balance makes the story feel grounded and believable, with just a touch of magic.
- The protagonist — a black cat — grows by learning from its peers the value of trust and teamwork, which becomes essential for survival in an apocalyptic world.

❌ What Didn’t Work

- There are noticeable plot gaps. For instance, the dog initially departs with its pack but later reappears on the boat with the cat. Either a key scene was missing, or the transition was poorly explained.
- The secretary bird’s ascent into the sky seems intended as a metaphor for death, but the lack of buildup makes the moment feel abrupt and confusing. The surrealism clashes with the otherwise grounded tone.
- While the main animal characters are portrayed with striking realism, the sea creatures are imaginary. This may be a deliberate choice to emphasize the fantastical nature of the water, but personally, I would have preferred realistic depictions of fish and whales to maintain consistency.

🌟 Favorite Moment

The ending stands out: the black cat overcomes its timid, self-preserving instincts and bravely rescues its friends from the stranded boat in the tree — a powerful moment of growth and courage.

## 🎯 Final Verdict

*Without a single spoken word, the film manages to be beautifully expressive.*
